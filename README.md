"Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won" - Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington

#### Communication 

"The secret of war lies in the communications" - Napoleon Bonaparte

Combat is a mess. Paths for messengers and systems for communication to officers must be controlled in order to give a new command to a regiment. 

They also take time to be received.

If a communication with a regiment in combat is lost, no new commands may be given to it and a huge impact on morale will affect them when they hear no news from the rest of the army.

"The amateurs discuss tactics the professionals discuss logistics" - Napoleon Bonaparte

Roads and paths must be designed by the player so he can move forces.

One of the most important things to keep your armies in shape and ready is the supplies needed: food, ammo and medical resources. Keeping the roads secured to reach destination is essential to allow your armies to continue fighting and maintain moral.

#### Paths

Forces and supplies moves by roads. These must be chosen and secured by the player in order to be used. This task is done for scouts and takes time. 

A path may be blocked by an army. Obviously scouts aren't capable to face them, so its either time to look for another path or fight them out. 

There are several types of roads, with different quality. The better they are the fastest the forces will move through.
