### The main character

#### Responsibilities

On the beginning the player is a marshal with an army. He can recruit, train, march, and command only his army. But no sane person would let a successful marshal as a general of only one army.

#### Field marshal

This is when the player becomes officer of all the armies of his country. In here lies the duty of leading his armies to war. 

#### Secretary of war

A secretary of war is the higher military rank in a republic. In him lies the job of manage founds for war, manage the armies and counsel the president.

He has the ability to take at his discretion from the treasure, as long as he doesn't take more than he need. Political favor decay when sources are designated to war and many politicians will dislike this.

#### President

A country utter most position can be given to the player. It does take to win the timed **elections** by having superior political favor over the other candidates... or skip all this and make a **coup**. 

For the next 3 years, with this charge, he is not required to complete any task and he can take from the treasure at will. He also will manage the public work, taxation, the military, and diplomacy with other countries.

##### Elections

A election is hold every 3 years. Whoever has more political favor will become president the next day.

##### Coup

### Battle command

"Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won" - Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington

Battles take place in a real time where the forces that reach the combat zone and engage each other in a standoff with tactics from the Napoleonic era. As general you are in charge of controlling the forces and leading them in battle.

As soon as a confrontation between armies start time will be slowed to real time clock. In these time players will manage the battle in focus view (they can leave this view but time will be paused)

#### Armies

Troops are organized in armies. These are large groups of forces managed by 1 marshal that lead all the regiments of the army. A regiment is form by a group of soldiers that form as one large military unit.

#### Marshal

The marshal is the higher ranking officer in the field. They will lead armies in favor or against you.

##### Abilities

A marshal can have certain abilities that can be used in battle. They have limits and/or cooldowns.

These abilities are:

- Motivate troops: Increase the moral of a regiment
- 

#### Communication 

    "The secret of war lies in the communications" - Napoleon Bonaparte

Combat is a mess. Paths for messengers and systems for communication to officers must be controlled in order to give a new command to a regiment. 

They also take time to be received.

If a communication with a regiment in combat is lost, no new commands may be given to it and a huge impact on morale will affect them when they hear no news from the rest of the army.

Disrupting enemy communications is also possible cutting them from his general to take control of their actions.

### Army management

"The amateurs discuss tactics the professionals discuss logistics" - Napoleon Bonaparte

Roads and paths must be designed by the player so he can move forces.

One of the most important things to keep your armies in shape and ready is the supplies needed: food, ammo and medical resources. Keeping the roads secured to reach destination is essential to allow your armies to continue fighting and maintain moral.

#### Paths

Forces and supplies moves by roads. These must be chosen and secured by the player in order to be used. This task is done for scouts and takes time. 

A path may be blocked by an army. Obviously scouts aren't capable to face them, so its either time to look for another path or fight them out. 

There are several types of roads, with different quality. The better they are the fastest the forces will move through.

#### Disrupting enemy logistics



### Politics

    "War is too serious to be entrusted to generals" - Georges Clemenceau

In the game are managed by politicians who can support your troops or not. Gaining favors requires accomplishing missions for them so they can support you and secure their position. With more **political favor** you will have more resources designated for war.

Apart from political favor you can win people favor 

You can also try to make a coup and remove the current president. This process establish you as the de facto president or a new one allowing to gain more resources for war but losing the favor of the people.
